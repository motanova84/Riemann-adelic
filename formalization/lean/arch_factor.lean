Archimedean gamma-factor rigidity.

The Archimedean factor γ_∞(s) = π^(-s/2) Γ(s/2) satisfies the functional equation
and contributes to the completion of the zeta function. The Weil index and
stationary-phase analysis establish the precise form of this factor.

Full formalization: This is incorporated into the definition of Ξ(s) in RH_final_v6.lean

Stub: The Weil index and stationary-phase arguments are standard results
from harmonic analysis on adeles. The completed zeta function Ξ incorporates
these factors by construction.
