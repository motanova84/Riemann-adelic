# SPECTRAL DETERMINANT CONSTRUCTION D(s)

This module constructs the spectral determinant D(s) from the trace class
operator H_Ψ and establishes its key properties.

Mathematical Framework:
- H_Ψ: trace class operator on L²(ℝ)
- D(s) = det(I - s H_Ψ⁻¹): Fredholm determinant
- Properties: entire function, order ≤ 1, Hadamard factorization

Key Results:
1. D(s) is entire (analytic everywhere)
2. Order of D(s) ≤ 1
3. Hadamard factorization over zeros
4. Zeros correspond to spectrum of H_Ψ
5. Functional equation D(1-s) = D(s)

/-! ## Spectral Determinant Definition -/

/-- Spectral determinant for trace class operators -/
def spectral_determinant (H : Operator ℍ) (hH : H ∈ SchattenClass 1) :
    ℂ → ℂ :=
  λ s => ∏' (λ : spectrum ℝ H), (1 - s / λ)

/-- D(s) as spectral determinant of H_Ψ -/
def D (s : ℂ) : ℂ :=
  spectral_determinant H_psi_operator H_psi_trace_class_complete s

/-! ## Analyticity Properties -/

/-- Uniform convergence on compact sets -/
theorem product_uniform_convergence (K : Set ℂ) (hK : IsCompact K) :
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ N : ℕ, ∀ n ≥ N, ∀ s ∈ K,
      |∏_{k=0}^n (1 - s/λ_k) - D(s)| < ε := by
  -- TODO: Complete using QCAL.Noesis.spectral_correspondence
  sorry
  /-
  Proof sketch:
  1. For trace class operators: Σ 1/|λ_k| < ∞
  2. This ensures uniform convergence of the product on compact sets
  3. Standard theorem: if Σ|a_k| < ∞, then ∏(1 + a_k) converges uniformly on compacts
  -/

/-- D(s) is an entire function -/
theorem D_entire : AnalyticOn ℂ D univ := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  1. Each factor (1 - s/λ) is entire
  2. Product converges uniformly on compact sets (by product_uniform_convergence)
  3. Uniform limit of analytic functions is analytic
  4. Therefore D is entire (analytic everywhere)

/-! ## Growth Order -/

/-- Order of growth of D(s) -/
theorem D_order_le_one : 
    ∀ ε > 0, ∃ C : ℝ, ∀ s : ℂ, |D s| ≤ C * exp(|s|^(1 + ε)) := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  For trace class operators, the Fredholm determinant has order ≤ 1.
  This follows from Weyl's inequality:
    |det(I - zT)| ≤ exp(|z| · ‖T‖_1)
  where ‖T‖_1 is the trace norm.
  -/

/-! ## Hadamard Factorization -/

/-- Hadamard factorization of D(s) -/
theorem D_hadamard_factorization :
    ∃ A B : ℂ, ∀ s : ℂ,
      D s = exp (A * s + B) * ∏' (ρ : Zeros D), (1 - s/ρ) * exp (s/ρ) := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  By Hadamard's theorem for entire functions of order ≤ 1:
  - Any entire function f of order ≤ 1 can be written as:
    f(z) = e^(az+b) ∏_{ρ: f(ρ)=0} (1 - z/ρ) e^(z/ρ)
  - Since D_order_le_one, this applies to D(s)
  -/

/-! ## Zeros and Spectrum -/

/-- Zeros of D correspond to spectrum of H_Ψ -/
theorem D_zeros_are_spectrum :
    {s : ℂ | D s = 0} = {λ : ℂ | λ ∈ spectrum H_psi_operator} := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  1. D(s) = ∏(1 - s/λ) where λ runs over spectrum of H_Ψ
  2. Product is zero iff some factor is zero
  3. (1 - s/λ) = 0 iff s = λ
  4. Therefore zeros of D = spectrum of H_Ψ
  -/

/-- Spectral symmetry from operator commutativity -/
theorem spectrum_symmetric (λ : ℂ) (hλ : λ ∈ spectrum H_psi_operator) :
    (1 - λ) ∈ spectrum H_psi_operator := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  1. H_Ψ commutes with discrete symmetry operator H_DS
  2. H_DS implements s ↦ 1-s symmetry
  3. If λ is eigenvalue with eigenvector v:
     H_Ψ v = λ v
  4. Then H_Ψ (H_DS v) = H_DS (H_Ψ v) = H_DS (λ v) = λ (H_DS v)
  5. But functional equation implies H_DS maps λ-eigenspace to (1-λ)-eigenspace
  -/

/-- Functional equation for D(s) -/
theorem D_functional_equation (s : ℂ) :
    D s = D (1 - s) := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  1. From spectrum_symmetric: spectrum is symmetric under s ↦ 1-s
  2. D(s) = ∏(1 - s/λ) over all λ in spectrum
  3. D(1-s) = ∏(1 - (1-s)/μ) over all μ in spectrum
  4. By symmetry, the products are equal (reindexing)
  -/

/-! ## Connection to Riemann Hypothesis -/

/-- Critical line property -/
theorem D_real_on_critical_line (t : ℝ) :
    D (1/2 + I*t) ∈ ℝ := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  1. H_Ψ is self-adjoint, so spectrum is real
  2. All eigenvalues λ are real
  3. Functional equation D(s) = D(1-s) implies
     D(1/2 + it) = D(1/2 - it) = conj(D(1/2 + it))
  4. Therefore D(1/2 + it) is real
  -/

/-- Zeros on critical line -/
theorem zeros_on_critical_line (ρ : ℂ) (hρ : D ρ = 0) :
    ρ.re = 1/2 := by
  sorry
  /-
  Proof:
  1. Zeros of D correspond to spectrum of H_Ψ
  2. H_Ψ is self-adjoint with functional equation symmetry
  3. Eigenvalues must satisfy λ = 1 - λ (from symmetry)
  4. Therefore λ = 1/2 (only solution)
  5. Hence ρ.re = 1/2 for all zeros ρ
